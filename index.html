      <h1>Poor Man's Component Islands</h1>
      <p>
        This page is an implementation of the islands architecture pioneered by
        Katie Sylor Miller at Etsy in 2019.
      </p>
    </header>

    <main>
      <h2>The island architecture</h2>

      <p>
        The island architecture uses server-side rendering to compose static
        content and placeholders for the interactive content. The code for the
        interactive content is not immediately linked to the page. Instead, a
        loader is used to fetch the additional code when the content is in view.
      </p>

      <p>
        The term "islands" refers to the fact that interactive components may
        be surrounded by static server-rendered content, creating islands of
        placeholders that are hydrated in a just-in-time fashion.
      </p>

      <p>
        Compared to a monolithic web application, or a bundled micro-frontend,
        the island architecture will significantly delay loading components on
        a longer page where not all of them are needed at once. In a more
        "application" like setup where everything is contained within the
        viewport right off the bat, this architecture will be less efficient as
        it will require multiple HTTP connections to fetch the code.
      </p>

      <h2>Poor man's islands implementation</h2>

      <p>
        The poor man's islands implementation uses a 11-line, 322-byte loader
        script (unminified) to hydrate the island components. The components are
        represented in the HTML via custom elements.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the page loads, the loader goes through all DOM nodes on the page,
        finds custom elements, and then loads a script that matches the name
        if the component is in the viewport area, or sets up an intersection
        observer to load the component when it is in the viewport.
      </p>

      <p>
        The loader is (currently) limited to detecting components that are in
        the viewport, and it does not cover situations where it is otherwise
        impossible to interact with it (hidden, contained within hidden
        elements, completely obscured by another element,
        <code>pointer-events</code> set to <code>none</code>, etc.).
      </p>

      <h2>Why custom elements</h2>

      <p>
        Custom elements have been chosen because of the simplicity of
        identifying the root node of the application, and because it does not
        require the loader the control the initialization. The second reason
        custom elements have been chosen is that, until touched by CSS, custom
        elements have no appearance and do not affect the page in any way.
      </p>

      <p>
        The drawback of relying on custom element name alone for figuring out
        where the islands are is that it requires iterating over literally every
        element on the page to find them. In the future, we may use an attribute
        for this purpose, to narrow down the elements that we need to look at.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even though we use a custom element in this implementation, that does
        not necessarily mean that we cannot use UI libraries and frameworks.
        Most frameworks will allow you to attach their components to a
        specific node on the page, and there's no reason why that node wouldn't
        be the island's custom element.

      <p>
        This page contains a single component island using a
        <code>&lt;test-island></code> custom element. After being loaded, it
        pulls in its own stylesheets.
